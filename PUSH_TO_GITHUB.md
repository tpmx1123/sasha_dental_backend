# How to Push Backend to GitHub

## Current Status
✅ Backend code is committed and ready to push
✅ Branch is set to `main`

## Steps to Push:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `DENTAL_BACKEND` (or your preferred name)
3. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
4. **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push
Once you have the repository URL, run these commands:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\YES LORVENS\Desktop\DENTAL_BACKEND\project\Backend"
git remote add origin https://github.com/G-ESWARBHAI/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual repository name!**

### Alternative: If Repository Already Exists
If the repository already exists, just provide the URL and I can push it for you.

## Quick Command (After Creating Repo):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/G-ESWARBHAI/DENTAL_BACKEND.git
git push -u origin main
```
